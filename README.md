# Relativistic Operator Geometry in Quansistor Field Mathematics  
**An Operator-First Framework for Geometry, Arithmetic, and Consistency**

## Overview

This whitepaper develops a fully **operator-first geometric framework**, in which geometry is not embedded in a background space or spacetime, but **emerges from algebraic relations between operators**.

The framework is explicitly relativistic in spirit:  
there is **no global time**, no preferred frame, and no external coordinate system.  
All structure arises internally from operator relations, noncommutativity, and spectral constraints.

## Core Thesis

> Geometry is not a background arena in which computation happens.  
> Geometry *is* the consistency structure induced by interacting operators.

This reframes geometry as:
- intrinsic rather than embedded,
- relational rather than me
